# TLA+ Verified Areas — Hazmat

This document is the authoritative record of which subsystems are under formal
verification, what was proved or disproved, and the governance rules that apply
to future changes in those areas.

Important scope boundary: the current TLA+ suite governs Hazmat's core
containment, rollback, seatbelt, backup, and core version-migration logic. It
does **not** yet model harness-specific lifecycle and import state such as
Claude/OpenCode curated imports, per-harness metadata under `~/.hazmat/state.json`,
or session-only integration activation/pinning. That work is tracked separately
and should not be implied by the existing proofs.

Important additional scope boundary: the current TLA+ suite now includes the
host-side Tier 3 launch boundary for Docker-capable sessions: mount-planner
exclusions, zero extra env passthrough in the current implementation, backend
readiness gating, and policy-before-launch ordering. It still does **not**
model Docker Sandbox or microVM internals, container runtime behavior after
launch, Compose semantics, or future non-Docker backends.

Important equivalence boundary: the current suite also models a backend-neutral
effective-policy contract shared by Tier 2 and Tier 3. It proves a narrower
core containment equivalence and disproves exact backend identity. The suite
does **not** claim that Seatbelt policy and Docker Sandbox runtime behavior are
identical implementations.

Important session-mutation boundary: the current suite does **not** model
session-time host permission repairs such as project ACL repair, `.git`
metadata ACL repair, exposed-directory traverse ACL repair, or Homebrew
toolchain permission repair. Hazmat now surfaces these operations explicitly in
the session contract with proof scope metadata, but they remain governed by
tests and documentation rather than the current TLA+ specs.

## Governance Rules

### When TLA+ is required

A change to a verified subsystem **must** be accompanied by TLA+ analysis before
committing. Specifically:

1. **Code changes in a verified area** — re-run TLC against the existing spec to
   confirm the invariants still hold after your change. If the spec's model no
   longer matches the new code, update the spec first, prove the new invariants
   with TLC, then update the implementation to match the proved design.

2. **Spec update before implementation** — if you want to change the correctness
   properties (e.g., relax an invariant, add a new one), write and prove the new
   spec first. Only then propagate the design to implementation. Do not implement
   first and update the spec to match.

3. **New setup or rollback steps** — if you add a new resource to the setup
   chain, add it to the TLA+ model first. Prove that the ordering preserves
   all invariants, then implement.

4. **Reordering steps** — any change to the order of setup or rollback steps
   must be modeled and proved before the code change. Step ordering is the
   primary source of bugs in this subsystem.

### What "proved" means here

TLC exhaustively checks all reachable states within the model bounds. A spec is
considered **proved** when TLC reports "No error has been found" with the bounds
listed in each spec's `.md` file. See `USAGE.md` for how to run TLC.

### Spec files

File naming convention: `MC_<slug>.tla` + `MC_<slug>.cfg`.

## Verified Subsystems

### 1 — Setup/Rollback State Machine

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/01_setup_rollback_state_machine.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_SetupRollback.tla`, `tla/MC_SetupRollback.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/init.go` — `runInit()`, all `setupX()` functions |
| Governed code | `hazmat/rollback.go` — `runRollback()`, all `rollbackX()` functions |
| Key invariants | `AgentContained`, `NoOrphanedArtifacts`, `SudoersRequiresHelper`, `AgentDepsRequireUser` |
| Key liveness | `CanAlwaysReachClean` |
| Status | **Fixed** — containment before privilege in both setup and rollback |

**What was found:**

1. **Setup:** sudoers was installed (step 8) before pf firewall (step 9). If
   setup was interrupted between those steps, the agent was launchable without
   firewall containment.

2. **Rollback:** pf firewall was removed (step 2) before sudoers (step 4). If
   rollback was interrupted between those steps, the agent remained launchable
   with the firewall already gone. Mirror image of the setup bug.

**Fixes applied:**

1. **Setup:** Reordered so pf/dns/daemon run before launchHelper and sudoers.
2. **Rollback:** Reordered so sudoers is removed first, before firewall/dns/daemon.

The principle: **grant privilege last, revoke privilege first.**
`AgentContained` and `CanAlwaysReachClean` now pass across all 29,518 reachable
states (55,726 generated, ~7s with liveness enabled).

The bounded-retry model does **not** currently prove `SetupEventuallyCompletes`.
If setup and rollback attempts are both exhausted after repeated failures, TLC
can stutter in a partially configured idle state. Hazmat's current checked
liveness bar for this model is recoverable clean exit, not guaranteed eventual
successful completion after arbitrary bounded failures.

**Change rules:**
- Any change to setup step ordering must be modeled and proved against
  `AgentContained` before committing.
- Adding a new setup step requires adding the corresponding resource variable
  and updating `SetupStepSucceed` / `RollbackCore` / `RollbackDestructive`.
- Adding a new rollback step (e.g., a new `--delete-X` flag) requires a new
  rollback action in the spec.
- Changes to which resources rollback preserves vs. removes must be reflected
  in `RollbackCore` and checked against `NoOrphanedArtifacts`.

---

### 2 — Seatbelt Policy Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/02_seatbelt_policy_structure.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_SeatbeltPolicy.tla`, `tla/MC_SeatbeltPolicy.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/session.go` — `generateSBPL()`, `isWithinDir()` |
| Key invariants | `CredentialReadDenied`, `CredentialWriteDenied`, `ReadDirsNoWrite`, `ProjectDirWritable`, `ReadDirSubsumption`, `ResumeDirNotCredential` |
| Status | **Fixed** — credential denies cover both ops; resume dir + project re-assertion modeled |

**What was found:** Credential deny rules only blocked `file-read*`, not
`file-write*`. Two vectors: (a) `ProjectDir = /Users/agent` granted write to
`.ssh`; (b) static `.config` allow covered `.config/gcloud` writes.

**Fixes applied:**

1. Changed deny rules from `(deny file-read* ...)` to
   `(deny file-read* file-write* ...)`. Both reads and writes to all credential
   paths are now denied regardless of user input.

2. Added `ResumeDir` (section 3) — optional read+write allow for the invoking
   user's session directory when `--resume` or `--continue` is used. This path is
   under the invoker's home (e.g., `/Users/dr/.claude/...`), never under agent home,
   so it cannot overlap with credential paths. `ResumeDirNotCredential` verifies this.

3. Added project write re-assertion (section 5) — when a read-only `-R` directory
   is a parent of the project directory, the project's write access is re-asserted
   as the last allow before credential denies.

Policy sections are now: 0=system libs, 1=read dirs, 2=project r+w, 3=resume dir,
4=agent home, 5=project write re-assert, 6=credential denies.

**Change rules:**
- Do not reorder the sections in `generateSBPL()` — credential denies MUST be
  last. Moving any allow after the denies would break `CredentialReadDenied`.
- Adding new credential paths to the deny list requires adding them to
  `CredPaths` in the TLA+ model and re-running TLC.
- Adding new static allow paths (new `AgentHomeSubs`) requires checking whether
  they cover any credential paths — add to the model and re-verify.
- Adding new optional read+write sections (like ResumeDir) requires modeling the
  path and verifying it cannot overlap with `CredPaths`.

---

### 3 — Backup/Restore Safety

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/03_backup_restore_safety.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_BackupSafety.tla`, `tla/MC_BackupSafety.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/kopia_wrapper.go` — `openLocalRepo()`, `snapshotProject()`, `runCloudBackup()`, `runCloudRestore()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/restore.go` — `runProjectRestore()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/session.go` — `preSessionSnapshot()`, session commands |
| Key invariants | `RestoreReversible`, `RepoBeforeSnapshot`, `CloudRequiresConfig`, `NoOverwriteWithoutAttempt` |
| Key liveness | `SessionEventuallyLaunches`, `RestoreEventuallyCompletes` |
| Status | **Fixed** — cloud restore now takes pre-restore snapshot before overwriting |

**What was found:**

1. **Cloud restore:** `runCloudRestore()` overwrote the entire workspace without
   taking a pre-restore snapshot. If the cloud snapshot was stale or wrong, the
   user's current workspace was permanently lost with no undo. The local restore
   path (`runProjectRestore()`) did this correctly.

**Fix applied:**

1. Added `snapshotProject(cloudBackupDir, "pre-cloud-restore")` to
   `runCloudRestore()` before the overwrite, matching the pattern in
   `runProjectRestore()`. Failure is non-fatal (warn and proceed).

The principle: **every overwrite must be preceded by a snapshot attempt.**
`RestoreReversible` now passes across all 395 distinct states (<1s).

**Change rules:**
- Adding a new restore path (e.g., restore from external drive) must include a
  pre-restore snapshot step. Add the path to the TLA+ model and verify
  `RestoreReversible` still holds.
- Changing when `preSessionSnapshot()` is called relative to sandbox entry must
  preserve the ordering: snapshot before sandbox boundary.
- Adding new snapshot triggers must ensure `openLocalRepo()` auto-init is
  called first (modeled by `RepoBeforeSnapshot`).

### 4 — Version Migration and Rollback from Any State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/04_version_migration.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_Migration.tla`, `tla/MC_Migration.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/init.go` — migration dispatch, `runInit()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/migrate.go` — migration functions (per-version) |
| Governed code | `hazmat/rollback.go` — `runRollback()`, artifact removal ordering |
| Governed code | `~/.hazmat/state.json` — core init version tracking (`harnesses` metadata is currently out of model) |
| Key invariants | `AgentContained`, `InitComplete`, `VersionConsistent`, `FailureRecoverable`, `MigrationForward`, `RollbackClean`, `RollbackAlwaysAvailable` |
| Key liveness | `EventuallyComplete` |
| Status | **Proved** — 44,795 states, 140,535 transitions, 0 errors (3s) |

**What this verifies:**

1. **Forward migration:** Upgrading from any previous init version (v0.1.0,
   v0.2.0) to the current binary version (v0.3.0) produces a consistent
   system with exactly the expected artifacts. Migrations are sequential —
   no version is skipped.

2. **Rollback from any state:** The system can reach a clean state (zero
   artifacts) via rollback from any intermediate state: fully initialized,
   mid-migration, or after a migration failure. Rollback respects ordering
   constraints — sudoers is removed before pfAnchor (revoke privilege
   before removing containment).

3. **AgentContained everywhere:** Across all 44,795 reachable states —
   including partial migrations, failed states, and partial rollbacks — the
   agent is never launchable without firewall containment.

4. **Failure recovery:** From any failed state, the user can either retry
   init (resume migration) or start rollback. No state is permanently stuck.

**What was found during spec development:**

1. **Liveness violation:** The first version used weak fairness on
   `MigrateSucceed`, which allowed an infinite fail → recover → fail loop
   without progress. TLC caught this. Fixed with strong fairness (models
   the assumption that transient failures eventually clear).

**Change rules:**
- Adding a new hazmat version requires adding it to `MC_Migration.tla`:
  new `V4` constant, `Expected(V4)` definition, `HasMigration(V3, V4)`,
  and `NextVersion(V3) == V4`. Run TLC — it checks all paths from every
  older version through the new migration, including rollback.
- The `CanRemove` function defines rollback ordering constraints. If a new
  artifact depends on another (like sudoers depends on pfAnchor), add the
  constraint there and re-verify.
- The `AgentContained` invariant must pass across ALL states — init,
  migration, failed, and rollback. This is the non-negotiable property.

---

### 5 — Tier 3 Launch Containment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/05_tier3_launch_containment.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_Tier3LaunchContainment.tla`, `tla/MC_Tier3LaunchContainment.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/sandbox.go` — `buildSandboxLaunchSpec()`, `prepareSandboxLaunch()`, `loadHealthySandboxLaunchBackend()`, `dockerSandboxesBackend.PrepareLaunch()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/integration_manifest.go` — `isCredentialDenyPath()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/session.go` — `isWithinDir()` |
| Key invariants | `CredentialPathsNeverMounted`, `ProjectMountedRW`, `PlannedReadDirsMountedRO`, `CoveredReadDirsOmitted`, `NoUnexpectedLaunchEnv`, `BackendValidationBeforeLaunch`, `PolicyBeforeLaunch`, `ApprovalBeforeLaunch`, `IntegrationEnvRejected`, `ShellVersionGate`, `ExtraWorkspaceVersionGate` |
| Status | **Fixed and Proved** — Tier 3 mount planning now rejects credential deny zones, filters covered read-only mounts, and preserves policy-before-launch gating |

**What was found:**

1. The initial Tier 3 Docker Sandboxes path mounted `ProjectDir` and
   `ReadDirs` directly, without a Tier 3 equivalent of the credential deny-zone
   checks already used for integration `read_dirs`.

2. The initial Tier 3 mount path also did not filter read-only directories
   already covered by the project directory or by another broader read-only
   directory, even though Tier 2 already applies that filtering in
   `generateSBPL()`.

**Fixes applied:**

1. Added `buildSandboxLaunchSpec()` as the explicit Tier 3 mount planner. It
   rejects project/read-only mount inputs that resolve to credential deny zones
   and filters read-only mounts already covered by the project or another
   broader reference path.

2. Updated Tier 3 launch compatibility checks and sandbox naming to use the
   effective read-only mount set rather than raw `ReadDirs`, so redundant
   `-R` inputs do not trigger spurious extra-workspace version gates or create
   distinct sandbox identities for the same effective mount plan.

The principle: **Tier 3 must prove its host-side launch boundary explicitly;
it cannot inherit Tier 2's Seatbelt guarantees by implication.** TLC now
passes across all 23,580 reachable states (33,876 generated, depth 9, ~1s).

**Change rules:**
- Any change to Tier 3 mount planning must preserve both properties:
  no credential-zone mounts and no redundant read-only mounts. Update the
  TLA+ model first, then the Go implementation.
- Adding new credential deny paths requires updating both `credentialDenySubs`
  and `CredentialLeaves`/the abstract path model before committing.
- Reordering backend validation, approval, sandbox creation, policy
  application, or launch requires re-running TLC; `PolicyBeforeLaunch` and
  `BackendValidationBeforeLaunch` are load-bearing.
- Introducing any explicit Tier 3 env passthrough (for example launch-time
  API-key delivery) requires updating this spec first. The current proof only
  covers the zero-extra-env launch path in `hazmat/sandbox.go`.

---

### 6 — Tier 2 vs Tier 3 Effective Policy Equivalence

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Spec | `tla/06_tier2_tier3_effective_policy_equivalence.md` |
| TLA+ files | `tla/MC_TierPolicyEquivalence.tla`, `tla/MC_TierPolicyEquivalence.cfg` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/session.go` — `resolveSessionConfig()`, `generateSBPL()`, `agentEnvPairs()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/sandbox.go` — `prepareSandboxLaunch()`, `buildSandboxLaunchSpec()` |
| Governed code | `hazmat/integration_manifest.go` — `isCredentialDenyPath()` |
| Key invariants | `CredentialInputsRejectedInBoth`, `IntegrationEnvBreaksExactIdentity`, `ResumeBreaksExactIdentity`, `AncestorRewriteBreaksExactIdentity`, `CanonicalCoreContainmentEquivalent` |
| Status | **Proved** — exact Tier 2/Tier 3 identity is false by design, but the canonical core containment contract is equivalent across both backends |

**What was found:**

1. Exact backend identity is not a valid claim for the current product. The
   model proves three intentional divergence classes: integration env
   passthrough, host-side resume history behavior, and Tier 3 ancestor mount
   rewriting.

2. A real Tier 2 vs Tier 3 mismatch existed in implementation: Tier 3 already
   rejected project/read/write roots that overlapped credential deny zones, but
   native Tier 2 session resolution did not reject the same inputs up front.

**Fix applied:**

1. Added credential-deny validation for explicit project, read-only, and
   read-write roots during native session resolution in
   `hazmat/session.go:resolveSessionConfig()`. Tier 2 now rejects the same
   unsafe inputs Tier 3 rejects.

The principle: **Hazmat may share one path-based containment contract across
tiers, but it must not claim stronger backend identity than the implementation
actually provides.** TLC passes across all 163,840 reachable states (327,680
generated, depth 1, 13s).

**Change rules:**
- Changes to project/read/write root normalization or credential-deny handling
  in either tier require re-running both this spec and the Tier 3 launch
  containment spec.
- Adding Tier 3 integration-env support requires updating this spec first; the
  current proof treats that difference as an intentional exact-identity break.
- Changing resume/continue transcript handling across tiers requires updating
  this spec first; host resume parity is currently outside the equivalent core
  containment contract.
- If Tier 3 ancestor-overlap rewriting changes, update the abstract
  `NeedsAncestorRewrite` model and re-prove the exact-identity break plus the
  canonical comparable subset.

## Not Yet Formally Modeled

- Harness-specific bootstrap/import lifecycle for Claude/OpenCode
- Per-harness metadata stored in `~/.hazmat/state.json`
- Harness-specific rollback semantics beyond the agent-home coarse model
- Integration activation, project pinning, and integration-specific snapshot ignore rules
- Session-time host permission repairs and their rollback semantics
- Docker Sandbox or microVM runtime internals after the host-side Tier 3 launch boundary
- Explicit Tier 3 API-key or other model-credential injection mechanisms, which are not yet implemented in `hazmat/sandbox.go`

Until a harness-specific spec exists, these areas are governed by tests and
documentation rather than the current TLC proofs.

## Workflow: Updating a Spec and Propagating to Code

```
1. Identify which spec governs the code you want to change.
   → See "Quick Reference" table above.

2. Write or update the .tla spec to model your intended design.
   → Use the skeleton in USAGE.md.
   → All new actions, variables, and transitions go in the spec first.

3. Run TLC to prove the invariants hold.
   → See USAGE.md for the exact command.
   → TLC must exit 0 ("No error has been found") with the model bounds.

4. If TLC finds a violation, revise the design (not the invariant) until it passes.

5. Implement the proved design in Go.

6. Update this file (VERIFIED.md): bump the status, add the commit ref,
   and note any change rules that were added or removed.
```

---

## Adding a New Verified Area

If you identify a new correctness hazard:

1. Write a new `NN_<slug>.md` in `tla/` following the existing format.
2. Add it to the table in `README.md`.
3. Add a row to the "Verified Subsystems" section above.
4. Write the `.tla` / `.cfg` files, run TLC, record the result here.
